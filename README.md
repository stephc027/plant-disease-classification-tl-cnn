Note: Python code downloads data from Kaggle API.  
Running the code as-is will require a Kaggle account + API token to authenticate.  This will lead to a download of a large image dataset.
Project can also be transferred to Kaggle to work with data at the link provided.

ABSTRACT

Deep learning for image classification is a continually developing pursuit which has begun to be applied to the agricultural field.  In this research, the New Plant Disease Dataset, consisting of 87,000 plant leaf images, is explored in an aim to classify the images by one of 38 categorizations, including health status and species type, is attempted through Convolutional Neural networks, Transfer Learning, and the combination of these.  In particular, EfficientNet, a class of models first introduced in 2019 and known for their superior accuracy and efficiency, is successful in its application to this problem.  Using CPU and EfficientNetB0 as a preliminary exploration into this possibility, an encouraging accuracy of 97.81% was achieved using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
